        No roadmap, no crazy promises. We are enjoying and appreciating the current condition and state of the market and would like to as a team to provide a project with quality art and to build a foundation for showcasing our artist's unique skills and styles. 
        We want to focus on art as our primary and behind that a community that appreciates the art and can look forward to more. 
        Our current plan is to release our Project Glitchpop GENESIS and then shortly following, we will be providing a secondary collection that follows along with the story of these girls that we have built up with Project GLITCHPOP thus far. We want to provide a free mint for those who hold our genesis and we assure that you will appreciate the art.
