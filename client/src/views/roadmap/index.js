        We want to focus on art as our primary and behind that a community that
        appreciates the art and can look forward to more. As we a portion of our
        supply is currently paid, we hope to have this to help continue
        motivating our artist towards her dream and being paid for her work for
        the first time ever. We understand the market conditions and will pivot
        accordingly, but as such we hope to in the future give back to the
        community and everyone who decides to join us on this journey with great
        art and a fully free mint that us degens can enjoy.

        We already have in the works following our Project Glitchpop GENESIS, a
        secondary collection that will follow towards these girl's
        transformation in the dream metaverse. We hope to continue this story
        telling through art. More details in regards to this will be soon after
        our initial release, but will 100% be a fully free mint. Normal,
        everyday girls, within their slumber, awaken into the metaverse dream
        world. Now they must find a way out of these dreams, before its too
        late...
